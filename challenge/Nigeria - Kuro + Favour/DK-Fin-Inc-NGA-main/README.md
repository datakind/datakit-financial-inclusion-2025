## üîç Key Insights

- **Gender Gap:** Males are more likely to adopt digital payments and mobile money services than females.
- **Urban vs Rural:** Urban residents exhibit significantly higher financial inclusion than rural dwellers.
- **Education & Income:** Higher levels of education and income positively correlate with access to digital financial services.
- **Savings & Borrowing:** Informal savings and borrowing dominate, especially in rural communities and among low-income groups.
- **Remittances:** Cash remains the dominant channel, but mobile money usage is growing.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Expand mobile money infrastructure**, especially in rural areas.
- **Promote financial literacy**, targeting women and low-income earners.
- **Collaborate with local fintechs** to tailor services to underserved populations.
- **Monitor digital gaps** to ensure inclusive growth in financial ecosystems.

---

## üìå Future Work

- Deeper modeling of financial behavior drivers using machine learning.
- Study of remittance inflows and their impact on household welfare.
- Comparative analysis with previous Findex waves (2014, 2017).
