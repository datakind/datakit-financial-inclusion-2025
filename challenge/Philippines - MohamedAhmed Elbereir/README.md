I would like to share some findings with respect to the data Im looking at:                                                                                                                       Digital Economy's Contribution to GDP

"Following this example; I compared factors correlating to financial inclusion; including  urban and rural divides,  demographic divides and class divides and found some insights I thought I should share here.
Account ownership varies significantly across demographic groups, with substantial improvements from 2019 to 2021 across all categories. However, the rate of improvement and absolute levels differ markedly between groups."

The data shows that socioeconomic class, age, and employment status are particularly strong predictors of account ownership, while gender differences have narrowed significantly.
Young adults showed the most dramatic improvement in account ownership, nearly quadrupling their rate, though they still lag behind other age groups. This suggests that digital financial services and targeted youth financial inclusion programs may be having a significant impact, but there remains substantial room for improvement.
Socioeconomic class shows the strongest correlation with account ownership, with a clear gradient from higher to lower income groups. The ABC class experienced the largest percentage point increase, suggesting that financial inclusion growth may be disproportionately benefiting those with higher incomes. The gap between ABC and E classes widened from 16 percentage points in 2019 to 36 percentage points in 2021, indicating growing inequality in financial inclusion.
