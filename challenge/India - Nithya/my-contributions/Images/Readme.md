ðŸ“Š Detailed Visualization Explanations
1. ðŸ“ˆ Line Plot: Year-wise Revenue per State
ðŸ§  Purpose:
To visualize how the revenue/expenditure of each Indian state has changed over the years.

ðŸ“Œ Key Observations:
â€¢ COVID-19 Impact: 2020â€“21 shows a visible dip in most states.
â€¢ Recovery & Growth: 2021â€“22 and 2022â€“23 show sharp increases post-pandemic.
â€¢ Top Performers: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal lead with the highest revenue figures.
â€¢ Smaller States like Goa, Sikkim, and Mizoram have relatively flat trends with low volumes.

2. ðŸ”¥ Heatmap: Normalized Revenue Across States and Years
ðŸ§  Purpose:
To compare how each state performed relative to its own highest revenue year.

ðŸ“Œ Key Observations:
â€¢ Visual fingerprint of each stateâ€™s peak year.
â€¢ Darker color â†’ better performance in that year.
â€¢ Shows growth recovery patterns, especially post-2020.

3. ðŸ“Š Bar Chart: Regression Slope per State (Growth Rate)
ðŸ§  Purpose:
To rank states by their average annual growth rate, calculated using linear regression slopes.

ðŸ“Œ Key Observations:
â€¢ Top growers: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh have the highest slopes, suggesting strong consistent growth.
â€¢ Flat or negative growth: Jammu & Kashmir, due to data unavailability, and Goa show lower slopes.
â€¢ States with volatile revenues may show medium or low slope even with sharp spikes.

ðŸ§® Bonus Visualization Ideas (Optional Enhancements):
