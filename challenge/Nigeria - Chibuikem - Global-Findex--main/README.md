# Objective

This project is an in-depth exploration of financial inclusion patterns and barriers globally, as captured in the 2021 Global Findex Database. Utilizing advanced data visualization tools and analytical frameworks, this project aims to provide valuable insights into financial account access, digital payment trends, savings and borrowing behaviors, and the barriers that hinder financial inclusion across diverse demographics such as gender, location, income, and age groups.

 # Features
-Gender-Based Financial Access: Analysis of disparities in account ownership and usage between men and women.
- Urban vs. Rural Dynamics: Exploration of the differences in financial behaviors and access between urban and rural populations.
- Income Quintile Analysis: Comparative study across different income levels to highlight trends in financial account usage and accessibility.
- Digital Payment Trends: Investigation of digital payment behaviors, including the rise of mobile money, card usage, and other transaction mediums.
- Barriers to Financial Inclusion: Identification of key challenges such as cost, documentation, trust, and geographical barriers preventing broader financial participation.
- Saving and Borrowing Patterns: Examination of saving methods (formal, informal, mobile) and borrowing sources (friends, family, formal accounts) across age groups.

# Data Sources
The project leverages data from the World Bank's Global Findex 2021 report, focusing on financial inclusion indicators from around the world.

# Tools Used
-Power BI Desktop: For crafting dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
- Microsoft Excel: For cleaning the dataset.

# Key Findings
1. Gender Disparities: A noticeable gap in financial account ownership exists between males and females, with potential implications for economic empowerment.
2. Urban Advantage: Urban populations demonstrate higher rates of financial inclusion compared to their rural counterparts.
3. Youth vs. Older Generations: Younger age groups (18-25 and 26-35) exhibit higher engagement in digital and savings channels.
4. Significant Barriers: Financial costs and documentation requirements are the most cited barriers to account ownership, with distinct trends across locations and demographics.

# Future Prospects
 
The insights generated by this project can serve as a foundation for policy recommendations, financial literacy campaigns, and technology-driven solutions aimed at closing the financial inclusion gap. This project also opens avenues for further research into how emerging technologies can address the barriers identified.
