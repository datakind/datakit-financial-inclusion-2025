üáµüá∞ Pakistan: Financial Inclusion & Enterprise Insights (DataKit Contribution)

üìå Project Summary
This project explores financial inclusion at the individual level and business dynamics at the enterprise level in Pakistan. Using survey microdata from the World Bank (Global Findex 2021 & Enterprise Survey 2022), the study aims to surface disparities in financial access and infrastructure bottlenecks, with a focus on gender, geography, and firm characteristics.

We contribute to DataKind's mission by sharing cleaned datasets, insights, and Power BI visualizations relevant to financial inclusion and economic opportunity in Pakistan.

üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation Process

‚úÖ 1. Raw Datasets
We started from 2 publicly available datasets:

Source	Dataset	Description
World Bank	Pakistan-2022-full-data.dta	Enterprise Survey (Firm-level)
World Bank	micro_pak.csv	Global Findex (Individual-level)

üîß 2. Cleaning Steps
Global Findex (micro_pak.csv)

Kept variables related to account ownership, digital payments, gender, urban/rural, mobile access, income quintile

Binary Labeling	Transformed 1/0 values into "Yes" / "No", "Female" / "Male", "Urban" / "Rural" for readability

Column Renaming	Renamed for clarity: account_mob ‚Üí mobile_account, anydigpayment ‚Üí digital_payment, etc.

Missing Values	Rows with >20% null values dropped

Export	Final file: findex_final.csv

Enterprise Survey (Pakistan-2022-full-data.dta)

Selected key variables: firm size, sector, infrastructure (electricity/internet), trade (exports/imports), credit access

Variable Mapping	a4a ‚Üí sector, a6a ‚Üí firm_size, b4 ‚Üí female_ownership, c3/c6 ‚Üí electricity access

Renaming & Transformation	Standardized binary values to Yes/No; converted percentage strings to numeric

Calculated Fields	Added new variable: total_export_pct = direct_export + indirect_export

Export	Final file: firm_final.csv
